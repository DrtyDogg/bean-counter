Budget
============

Description
------------

This is used for our home budgeting needs.  I created it because most budgeting applications are overly automated.  While using them I find myself not paying much attention because they handle almost everything for me.  So this was created to allow us to track the spending categories that I care about.  Manually entering in the data forces me to interact with the tool and is keeping me engaged in my budget.
